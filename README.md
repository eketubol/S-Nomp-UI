# S-Nomp-UI
This is by no means a finished product, I have limited programming skills and thought I would open source what I have done so far
in the hopes that I can get some assistance in completing the last of what is needing done.

What is still outstanding is:
1. Creating a javascript function to only load the data from the selected pool which can be selected from the drop down list on the 
top right of the page. 
2. Creating a new function either using cookies or localstorage to save the selected option from above so when the user decides to move
the dashboard to the wallet section it again only loads the selected pool from the drop down list.

I feel once this has been finished the website UI will become much more usable.
